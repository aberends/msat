    <title>Facter facts</title>

    <para>
      Facter is a part of Puppet that gathers all sorts of
      facts about a system. All the facts Facter can gather
      are pieces of information that are already on the
      system. For example, one has installed an Operating
      System (OS) on the system, so facter can know about
      the OS as long the OS is supported by the Facter
      library. Similarly, information like MAC addresses
      (the addresses of ethernet cards), are obtained by
      Facter via an OS interface. The complete list of facts
      as Facter sees them, can be obtained with:
<screen>
&t1p; <userinput>facter | grep -e fqdn -e ipaddress -e macaddress -e operatingsystem -e virtual</userinput>
fqdn = ds1.dmsat1.org
ipaddress => 192.168.5.14
ipaddress_em1 => 192.168.5.14
ipaddress_lo => 127.0.0.1
is_virtual => true
macaddress => 52:54:00:A8:05:0E
macaddress_em1 => 52:54:00:A8:05:0E
operatingsystem => CentOS
operatingsystemmajrelease => 6
operatingsystemrelease => 6.5
virtual => kvm
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
      So, what can we do with these facts? All facts, known
      by Facter, are in the local namespace of Puppet.
      Meaning, in Puppet code, one can use the pattern:
      ${&lt;factname&gt;} to get the value of a fact. For
      example:
<screen>
&t1p; <userinput>cat some_facts.pp</userinput>
notify {"fqdn: ${fqdn}":}
notify {"ipaddress: ${ipaddress}":}
notify {"macaddress: ${macaddress}":}
notify {"operatingsystem: ${operatingsystem}":}
notify {"virtual: ${virtual}":}

&t1p; <userinput>puppet apply some_facts.pp</userinput>

    <title>Environment facts</title>

    <para>
      Sometimes, the facts provided by Facter are not
      enough. Sometimes one wants to add facts to a system
      that cannot by found out from the system itself. An
      example is, the location in a datacentre where a
      system is placed, or the environment in which a system
      operates. Facter has a mechanism to find out facts by
      analyzing the shell environment. How one can add these
      environment fact is shown here:
<screen>
&t1p; <userinput>cat /etc/profile.d/depzone.sh</userinput>
export FACTER_depzone="dmsat1"

&t1p; <userinput>. /etc/profile.d/depzone.sh</userinput>
&t1p; <userinput>facter depzone</userinput>
dmsat1
