    We construct the target Linux systems in several phases.
    The minimal phases we need when we provisioning a Linux
    system with Puppet:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Bare metal deployment of the machine with the
          Linux OS via the Spacewalk server. The Cobbler
          part is used. We need a very bare kickstart
          profile to execute this task.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          OS provisioning of the bare Linux system with help
          of Puppet. In this phase, we configure basic infa
          clients, like NTP, DNS, etc.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    Since the bare metal deployment is done with help of the
    Spacewalk server, and since the RPM's for Puppet and the
    RPM's with the custom Puppet provisioning code all come
    from software channels on the Spacewalk server, it is
    essential, in our setup, to have a functioning Spacewalk
    server.

      The guide called <emphasis role="strong">MSAT
      guide</emphasis> discusses how to set up a Spacewalk
      server. See <xref

    <para>
      Synchronizing the software channels from the CentOS
      YUM repositories takes a long time. So, make sure to
      plan this and execute this task during night. It can
      take up to 8 hours!
