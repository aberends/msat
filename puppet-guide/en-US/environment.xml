  <title>Environments</title>

  <para>
    In this chapter, we mean by environment a piece of ICT
    infrastructure with elements that belong together. For
    example, we have a development environment, in which we
    have a network, some computer machines, an LDAP service,
    a DNS service, a Provisioning service (Spacewalk), etc.
    In other words, it is an infrastructure domain in which
    we provide different services and machines. Since we
    call it development environment, we give the suggestion
    that we develop in this environment.
  </para>

  <warning>
    <title>The notion of environment in this chapter must
    not be confused witht the Puppet parameter $enviornment.</title>

    <para>
      In the Puppet configuration one can set the parameter
      <emphasis>$environment</emphasis>, to define the set
      of configuration parameters used according to the
      Puppet <emphasis>Directory environments</emphasis>
      mechanism. Since the environment notion in this
      chapter also yields a puppet Parameter, we name it
      <emphasis>$depzone</emphasis>, for Deployment zone.
