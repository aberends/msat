  <title>Environments</title>

  <para>
    In this chapter we discuss different environment types
    that we envision. During the discussions we position the
    environments and characterise their properties.
  </para>

  <para>
    By environment we mean: collaborating ICT infrastructure
    elements on which services run.  In an environment, we
    have a network (data transport mechanism), some compute
    nodes (e.g. KVM machines), and data storage (e.g. disks
    on the KVM hosts). In the environment, we run an LDAP
    service, a DNS service, a Provisioning service
    (Spacewalk), etc. In other words, it is an
    infrastructure domain in which we provide different
    services.
  </para>

  <warning>
    <title>The notion of environment in this chapter must
    not be confused with the Puppet parameter
    $environment.</title>

    <para>
      In the Puppet configuration one can set the parameter
      <emphasis>$environment</emphasis>, to define the set
      of configuration parameters used according to the
      Puppet <emphasis>Directory environments</emphasis>
      mechanism. Since the environment notion in this
      chapter also yields a puppet Parameter, we name it
      <emphasis>$depzone</emphasis>, for Deployment zone.
    </para>
