  <title>Software management</title>
  <para>
    This chapter discusses how to manage software inside the
    Spacewalk server. To illustrate our strategy, we will
    create a Directory Server using software from a static
    software channel.
  </para>

  <para>
    After the RHDS (Red Hat Directory Server) is installed,
    we want to make the system dummy proof. In short, if an
    administrator is logged in on the system, he should not
    be able to simply change it by running <command>yum
    update</command>.  Hence, the requirements we impose on
    the installed system and its connection to the Spacewalk
    server are:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The yum repositories to which the system has
          access on the Spacewalk server must be constant.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          From the repositories it must be clear what
          version of the software set we are using.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </para>

    How to install the Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) is
    explained in <xref
    linkend="msat-guide-appendix1-rhds_install_guide" />.
  </para>

  <para>
    In order to install the RHDS software, we first need to
    create a new software channel. The remainder of this
    chapter explains all the steps to come up with a
    directory server that retrieves its software from cloned
    channels.
