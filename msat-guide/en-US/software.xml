  <title>Software management</title>
  <para>
    This chapter discusses how to manage software inside the
    Spacewalk server. To illustrate our strategy, we will
    create a Directory Server using software from a static
    software channel.
  </para>

  <para>
    After the RHDS is installed, we want to make the system
    dummy proof. In short, if an administrator is logged in
    on the system, he should not be able to simply change it
    by running <command>yum update</command>.
    Hence, the requirements we impose on the installed
    system and its connection to the Spacewalk server are:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The yum repositories to which the system has
          access on the Spacewalk server must be constant.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          From the repositories it must be clear what
          version of the software set we are using.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </para>

    How to install the Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) is
    explained in <xref
