    In this section we discuss what needs to be done on the
    host system. For the Directory Server KVM, we need: 
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A virtual network in which we let the Directory
          Server operate. We use the same network as the one
          in which the Spacewalk server runs, see <xref
          linkend="spacewalk-host-network" />.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Disk storage. The amount of disk storage is mostly
          determined by the amount of data and users one
          wants to store in the Directory Server. Since, for
          us, it is just a machine to test the function, we
          hardly need any disk space. So, a total of 5GB for
          all should suffice.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Memory for the virutal CPU. Again, since we just
          test the function and not the performance, we need
          512MB maximum.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

      The KVM Spacewalk server needs disk space to run on.
      We provide it by means of a LV (Logical Volume)
      created on the host. The creation is done as follows: 
<screen>
&hostp; <userinput>pvs</userinput>
  PV         VG        Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree
  /dev/sda3  vg_server lvm2 a--  931.00g      0
  /dev/sdb   b         lvm2 a--  931.51g 931.51g
  /dev/sdc   c         lvm2 a--  931.51g 931.51g
  /dev/sdd   d         lvm2 a--  931.51g 931.51g
  /dev/sde   e         lvm2 a--  931.51g 931.51g
  /dev/sdf   f         lvm2 a--  931.51g 931.51g

&hostp; <userinput>pvs -o +vg_extent_size /dev/sdb</userinput>
  PV         VG   Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree   Ext
  /dev/sdb   b    lvm2 a--  931.51g 931.51g 4.00m

&hostp; <userinput>lvcreate -n sw -l $((25 * 10 * 300)) b</userinput>
  Logical volume "sw" created

</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      The newly created LV, <filename
      class="devicefile">/dev/b/sw</filename>, can now be
      presented to the virtual machine creation command as
      block device for storage.

      From the information of the Spacewalk project, see
      <ulink
      url="https://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk">fedorahosted.org/spacewalk</ulink>,
      we know from the <emphasis role="bold">Spacewalk
      Installation Instructions</emphasis>, from a
      Prerequisites section that the minimum amount of RAM
      needed, is 2GB, but that 4GB is recommended. We know
      that on our host this requirement is no problem. We
      have 16GB of internal memory, which can be
      demonstrated with: 
      <screen>
&hostp; <userinput>cat /proc/meminfo | grep ^MemTotal</userinput>
MemTotal:       16435452 kB
