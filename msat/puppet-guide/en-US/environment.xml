<chapter id="environment">
  <title>Environments</title>

  <para>
    In this chapter we discuss different environment types.
    During the discussions we position the environments and
    characterise their properties.
  </para>

  <para>
    By environment we mean: ICT infrastructure on which
    default services run. The ICT infrastructure provides
    networks (data transport mechanism), compute nodes (data
    processing mechanism, e.g.  KVM machines), and data
    storage (e.g. disks on the KVM hosts). On the ICT
    infrastructure, we run default services, like NTP, LDAP,
    DNS, Provisioning (Spacewalk), etc.
  </para>

  <warning>
    <title>The notion of environment in this chapter must
    not be confused with the Puppet parameter
    $environment.</title>

    <para>
      In Puppet configuration one can set the parameter
      <emphasis>$environment</emphasis>, to define the set
      of configuration parameters used according to the
      Puppet <emphasis>Directory environments</emphasis>
      mechanism. Since the environment notion in this
      chapter also yields a puppet Parameter, we name it
      <emphasis>$depzone</emphasis>, for Deployment zone.
    </para>
